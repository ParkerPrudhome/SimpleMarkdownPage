# Welcome to my SimpleMarkdownPage Repo I may have <sub>misinterpreted</sub> the instructions

## What's going on
I followed the beginner html tutorial on freeCodeCamp.org to create the html file located in this repository because I thought the instructions were to create any simple webpage in html. 
I'm still not exactly sure those * *aren't* * the instructions but I saw one of these on someone else's github and thought I'd make one just in case. Either way I hope you enjoy the cute
cat photo page and this intro README and have a look around at my other project the Anki clone I so cleverly titled "Nanki". Thanks!
